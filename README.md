# StoryGAN CLEVR Dataset Generation

This is the code for StoryGAN adapted from [CLEVR dataset](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/clevr/).

## Step 1: Generating Images
First we render synthetic images using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), outputting both rendered images as well as a JSON file containing ground-truth scene information for each image.

```
wget https://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/graphics/blender/release/Blender2.78/blender-2.78b-linux-glibc219-x86_64.tar.bz2
bzip2 -d blender-2.78b-linux-glibc219-x86_64.tar.bz2
tar xopf blender-2.78b-linux-glibc219-x86_64.tar
export BLENDER_PATH="$PWD/blender-2.78b-linux-glibc219-x86_64"
export PATH=$BLENDER_PATH:$PATH
```

Blender ships with its own installation of Python which is used to execute scripts that interact with Blender; you'll need to add the `image_generation` directory to Python path of Blender's bundled Python. The easiest way to do this is by adding a `.pth` file to the `site-packages` directory of Blender's Python, like this:

```bash
echo $PWD/image_generation >> $BLENDER/$VERSION/python/lib/python3.5/site-packages/clevr.pth
```

where `$BLENDER` is the directory where Blender is installed and `$VERSION` is your Blender version; for example on OSX you might run:

```bash
echo $PWD/image_generation >> /Applications/blender/blender.app/Contents/Resources/2.78/python/lib/python3.5/site-packages/clevr.pth
```

```bash
cd image_generation
bash gen_img.sh
```

On OSX the `blender` binary is located inside the blender.app directory; for convenience you may want to
add the following alias to your `~/.bash_profile` file:

```bash
alias blender='/Applications/blender/blender.app/Contents/MacOS/blender'
```

The file `inc_output/CLEVR_scenes.json` will contain ground-truth scene information for all newly rendered images.

You can find [more details about image rendering here](image_generation/README.md).

## Step 2: Feature Generation
Next we generate ground truth features.

You can generate feature like this:

```bash
cd descripton_generation
python vec_questions.py
```

The file `inc_output/CLEVR_dict.npy` will then contain feature vectors for generated images.
